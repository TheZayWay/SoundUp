1. Working on upload_song Route (Done)
    Bug: circular import (Fixed by creating the upload route within __init__.py)
    Changes: 
    Imported secure_filename
    Imported current_user
    Added a user_id to the route
    New Bug: Song isnt hitting the database/ POST request is not being made through jinja template


2. Need to finish UploadSongForm (Done)
    Then can serve a jinja/html template and attempt to upload a song to database
    Changes: 
    Created a render_upload_song route


After being able to get song upload to hit DB must comment in 
Lines 93-103
Lines 148-150




After this route work on playing music route 
After this make all querys and finish all secondary routes
Make sure to include error validations for the backend 
After that finalize seeders 
Then backend is done for the moment!
